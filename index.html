With natural, safe and proven formulation offered by Brilliant Skin Essentials, it continuously creates accessible beauty products to fulfill the skin care needs of Filipinos. In November 2015, a young mother, 19 year old Glenda Dela Cruz Victorio from the Province of Morong, Rizal, suffered severe skin eruptions on her face. This caused the bubbly Glenda to shy away from people. But together with her husband Mart Crispher Victorio, she was struggling then to raise their first born by way of on-line reselling whatever low priced products they can buy in a famous commercial center in Manila. She sold candles, slippers and all sorts of cheap goods. This simple livelihood provided her family’s needs but the more work they do, the hours of travel, and stress — the more skin eruptions which affected Glenda’s confidence.Until Glenda thought of a brilliant idea.

                <p>Okay, so there’s a lot to unpack here. If you’re not familiar with rejuvenating sets, they’re basically sets of four or five products that promise whiter, brighter skin — the perfect glass skin, if you will. But they’re also quite controversial for containing too many active ingredients, and even tricky ones like hydroquinone and tretinoin, which require the careful supervision of dermatologists.

So why do people love rejuv sets so much? For one thing, they’re incredibly affordable. One set complete with 5 different skincare products can cost the same as, let’s say, a single cleanser that will take months to produce visible effects.

But while rejuv sets act fast, plenty of dermatologists say they’re not great for long-term use. They’re also not recommended for someone with sensitive skin. So is the Brilliant Skin rejuv set any different? My take: not really. I was hesitant to try it and after a few days I already noticed mild irritation and redness in certain areas. The toner especially was harsh. The sunblock and night cream I didn’t really mind.
